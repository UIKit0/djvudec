DjVuDec
Copyright (c) 2011 Tor Andersson.

DjVuDec is a decoder library for the DjVu image compression format.
This implementation is written in ANSI C, with a focus on simplicity
and small code size.

DjVuDec is based (vaguely) on the DjVuLibre code, which in turn
is based on the original LizardTech reference library, which grants
a patent license to all derived code in compliance with the GPL.
